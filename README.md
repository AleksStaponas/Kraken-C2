## Safety Features

- **Safe Decrypt Option:** Instantly restores files to prevent damage during testing.  
- **Reverse Shell:** Runs via Windows CMD for controlled simulation and has a connector for testing.  
- **Limited Impact:** Only files in a safe test folder are affected.
- **Sandboxed Directory** Preventing any other files being accessed in the file server.

## Fake Grub Restart
A fake GRUB loading screen is used as a distraction, allowing files to be encrypted. Following this, it has often been seen in real-world scenarios, such as fake shutdowns being used to allow an attacker to, e.g. , escalate privileges or even maintain persistence. However, after the fake GRUB restart, it continues to the Initial Phase.

## Windows 10 Fake Update  
A fake Windows update screen used as a distraction that encrypts discovered files and estimates a time so it is ready and not as alarming to users. Furthermore, this behaviour can often be related to other malware types, such as viruses, that use that time to spread through vulnerabilities such as zero-days, or even install rootkits onto a compromised machine.

## Initial Phase  
Initial lock screen phase with timer and shell connection. This is demonstrated as it is often used in real-world TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures), and is commonly shown in attackers' OPSEC operations, which they can use to further escalate privileges or obfuscate logs.

## Second Phase  
Critical phase with timer and increased demands, file deletion if requirements are met with simulated payment code. If demands are not met, this ethical ransomware runs a wipedown where the user's encrypted files are deleted, simulating similar behaviours to the NotPetya ransomware that would delete a compromised machine's files. In this case, it is simulated and only targets files in a specific directory.

# Updates
Cross-platform server with automated command deployment and privilege escalation support for Windows and Linux using LinPEAS and WinPEAS.

### Current features

- **TLS Encrypted Communication:** Secure connections via Java `SSLServerSocket`.
- **File Serving:** Sends files from a defined `Base_DIR` to clients.
- **Path Traversal Protection:** Blocks access outside the base directory.
- **Event Logging:** Records IP, timestamp, and request outcome in `IPLogs.json` (will be used to determine if an IP address is permitted to conenct to file server).
- **Threaded Connections:** Supports multiple clients concurrently.
- **Safety Checks:** Logs and blocks invalid or failed requests.
- **Directory and file creator** The script generates fake, encrypted-style files and directories with randomized timestamps within the past year mimicking common APT distraction methods.
- **Linux & Windows** The script now deploys the correct screen depending on operating system.

# TLS Keystore Setup

This project requires a Java keystore for TLS.

## Generate `server.keystore` for 

Run the following command:

```bash
keytool -genkeypair -alias server -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -keystore server.keystore -storepass changeit -keypass changeit -dname "CN=localhost, OU=Dev, O=MyOrg, L=MyCity, S=MyState, C=US" -validity 365
```
